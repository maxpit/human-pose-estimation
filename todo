 - data loader
	- create dataset with joints (Valentin)
	- adapt pipeline so that single data can be loaded and trained on (Valentin)

 - reprojection loss
	- backpropagation testen (Max)
	- n2h: timing difference (Max)

 - reprojection
	- use tf_smpl/projection.py with all points instead of just keypoints (probably slow)  

 - integration data loader and reprojection loss in existing pipeline
	- add reprojection loss to ops.py
	- configure trainer.py to work with new loss
